THIS IS A PRFOUND STEP FORWARD IN SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT FOR THE TEC1.

A small forth like system for the tec-1 and other sbc.

In no order, John Hardy, Ken Boak, Craig Jones and Craig Hart and maybe more folk have made a big breakthrough, read the announcement ...

### My attaempt to run v1.1
- cj sent me a EEPROM chip to load the code, its a AT28C64B. it will hang over the tec1d socket by 2 pins each side.
- need to make an adapter board to fix this. as can run a 28 pin in 24 pin rom socket
