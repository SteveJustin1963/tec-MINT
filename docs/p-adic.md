Hensel's lemma and p-adic numbers are mathematical concepts often used in number theory and algebra. Here's a simple explanation:

### What are p-adic numbers?
- **p-adic numbers** are a way of expanding numbers based on a prime \( p \). They form a system where the "closeness" of numbers is defined differently from real numbers. Instead of looking at the absolute difference, you look at divisibility by powers of \( p \). This creates a unique "completion" of rational numbers, similar to how real numbers complete rational numbers in a different way.

### Hensel's Lemma Overview
Hensel's lemma is like a "lifting tool." It starts with a solution to a polynomial modulo \( p \) (a prime number) and extends it to a solution modulo higher powers of \( p \), eventually constructing a solution in the p-adic integers.

#### The Main Idea:
1. **Start with a small solution:** You have a polynomial \( f(x) \) and a solution \( r \) such that \( f(r) \equiv 0 \mod p \).
2. **Check for simplicity:** Ensure \( f'(r) \not\equiv 0 \mod p \) (the derivative is non-zero modulo \( p \)).
3. **Lift to higher precision:** Use the formula \( r_{k+1} = r_k - \frac{f(r_k)}{f'(r_k)} \) (similar to Newton's method) to iteratively improve the solution, where each \( r_k \) solves the polynomial modulo \( p^k \).
4. **Converge to p-adic solution:** As \( k \to \infty \), \( r_k \) converges to a p-adic number.

### How to Use Hensel's Lemma
1. **Find an initial root mod \( p \):**
   For example, if \( f(x) = x^2 - 2 \) and \( p = 7 \), the solution modulo \( 7 \) is \( r_1 = 3 \) since \( 3^2 \equiv 2 \mod 7 \).

2. **Lift the root to higher moduli:**
   Use Hensel's lifting formula:
   - Calculate \( f(r_k) \) and \( f'(r_k) \) modulo \( p^k \).
   - Update the root as \( r_{k+1} = r_k - t \), where \( t \) solves \( t \cdot f'(r_k) \equiv -f(r_k) \mod p^k \).

3. **Iterate until desired precision:**
   Continue until you reach the desired power of \( p \) or until the sequence converges in the p-adic integers.

### Example:
To find a 7-adic square root of 2:
1. Start with \( r_1 = 3 \).
2. Compute corrections using the formula \( r_{k+1} = r_k - \frac{f(r_k)}{f'(r_k)} \) modulo \( 7^k \).
3. The sequence converges to a p-adic number representing the square root of 2.

### Practical Applications
- Factoring polynomials in modular arithmetic.
- Studying solutions to equations in \( \mathbb{Z}_p \), the ring of p-adic integers.
- Cryptography and number theory problems involving modular arithmetic.

This process is constructive, so you can program it for calculations, or work through examples manually to understand its mechanics.
